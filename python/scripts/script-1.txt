#Control commands:
#    SEQ, n      # Iterate to END n times. If n is -1 iterate for ever.
#    ENDSEQ      # Loopback to last SEQ while iteration < n
#    TIME, start, end
#                # The commands banded by TIME and ENDTIME to be executed only between start, end time in hours
#                # 24 hour clock.
#    ENDTIME     SKIP to ENDTIME if time criteria not met
#    PAUSE, n.n  # Pause execution for n.n seconds
#    COMPLETE    # End of script
#Hardware commands:
#    LPF, band   # Where band is LPF-160/LPF-80/LPF-40 etc. Mapping is involved to relay activation.
#    ANTENNA, source, dest
#                # Sets up a route between an antenna and a destination TX or RX capability.
#                # e.g. 160-Loop, FCDPro+. Mapping is involved to relay activation.
#    LOOP, band, extension
#                # Switch the loop to band, and extend the actuator to % extension.
#    RADIO,  CAT, radio, com_port, baud_rate
#                # Supported radios IC7100 | FT817, baud-rate. Must be executed to initiate CAT control.
#            FREQ, MHz
#                # Set the radio frequency to MHz using CAT
#            MODE, LSB|USB|...
#                # Set the radio mode using CAT
#Software commands:
#    WSPR    INVOKE                  # Invoke WSPR if not running. Must be running before any other WSPR command.
#            RESET                   # Reset
#            IDLE, on|off            # Set idle on/off, i.e stop RX/TX
#            BAND, B160 etc ...      # Set band for reporting
#            TX, on|off              # Set TX to 20% or 0%
#            POWER, nn.nn            # Adjust power output when using external radio TX
#            CYCLES, n               # Wait for n receive cycles
#            SPOT, on|off            # Set spotting on/off.
#    WSPRRY  OPTIONS, option_list    # Selection of -p -s -f -r -x -o -t -n. Must be set before START.
#            CALLSIGN, callsign      # Set callsign for tx data. Must be set before START.
#            LOCATOR, locator        # Set locator for tx data. Must be set before START.
#            PWR, power              # Set Tx power in dBm for tx data. Must be set before START.
#            START, f1, f2, f3, ...  # Start WsprryPi with the given frequency sequence and settings.
#            WAIT                    # Wait for WsprryPi to terminate
